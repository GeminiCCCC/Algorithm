# LeetCode

review every week:

## 1. quick sort/merge sort  
912 - https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array/  

## 2. number of sub arrays whose sum is K  
560 - https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/

## 3. LIS  
300 - https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/

## 4. Kadane  
53 - https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/

## 5. max sum of subarray not greater than k
```python
sorted_presum = [0] # add 0 to handle empty list case
ans = -sys.maxsize
running_sum = 0

for num in arr:
  running_sum += num
  target_sum = running_sum - k
  index = bisect_left(sorted_presum, target_sum)
  
  if index < len(sorted_presum): # if index == len(sorted_presum) it means all the previous presum is smaller than the target, so no valid subarray whose sum is no greater than k
    ans = max(ans, running_sum - sorted_presum[index])
    
    if ans == k:
      return k
    
    bisect.insort(sorted_presum, running_sum)

return ans
```
