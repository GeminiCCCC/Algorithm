**template:**

```python
class DSU:
    def __init__(self):
      # don't forget to initialize each component's parent to its self
      self.parents = [0,......n-1]
      self.ranks = [0]*n

    def self.find(x):
        # path compression
        if parents[x] != x:
          parents[x] = find(parents[x])

        return parents[x]

    def self.union(x, y):
        r1 = find(x)
        r2 = find(y) 

        # if root are the same, already unioned before, no need to continue
        if r1 != r2:
            # always assign the lower rank to higher rank
            if ranks[r1] > ranks[r2]:
                parents[r2] = r1
            elif ranks[r1] < ranks[r2]:
                parents[r1] = r2
            else:
                # if ranks are the same, assign either one is ok
                parents[r2] = r1
                ranks[r1] += 1

```

**1. to find if a graph has cycle**
```python
def hasCycle(edges):
    # build the graph from edges, if we are looping all the neighbors here, we will only create one edge for we can simply loop through the edges
    #graph = defaultdict(list)

    for u, v in edges:
    r1 = find(u)
    r2 = find(v)
    # this is because before union the new node, the root of the new node will always be itself, and we are doing the dfs here, if there is a cycle, by the time we see the neighbor second time, the neighbor would already had been unioned, which will give us r1 == r2
    if r1 == r2:
        # has cycle
        return True
    else:
        # or we can make union return True/False and save the if check here
        union(r1, r2)

    return False
```

**2. use size for the component to solve problem**
