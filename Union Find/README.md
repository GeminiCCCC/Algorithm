**template:**

```python
class DSU:
    def __init__(self):
      # don't forget to initialize each component's parent to its self
      self.parents = [0,......n-1]
      self.ranks = [0]*n

    def self.find(x):
        # path compression
        if parents[x] != x:
          parents[x] = find(parents[x])

        return parents[x]

    def self.union(x, y):
        r1 = find(x)
        r2 = find(y) 

        # if root are the same, already unioned before, no need to continue
        if r1 != r2:
            # always assign the lower rank to higher rank
            if ranks[r1] > ranks[r2]:
                parents[r2] = r1
            elif ranks[r1] < ranks[r2]:
                parents[r1] = r2
            else:
                # if ranks are the same, assign either one is ok
                parents[r2] = r1
                ranks[r1] += 1

```

**1. to find if a graph has cycle**
```python
def hasCycle(edges):
    # build the graph from edges, if we are looping all the neighbors here, we will only create one edge for we can simply loop through the edges
    #graph = defaultdict(list)

    for u, v in edges:
    r1 = find(u)
    r2 = find(v)
    # this is because before union the new node, the root of the new node will always be itself, and we are doing the dfs here, if there is a cycle, by the time we see the neighbor second time, the neighbor would already had been unioned, which will give us r1 == r2
    if r1 == r2:
        # has cycle
        return True
    else:
        # or we can make union return True/False and save the if check here
        union(r1, r2)

    return False
```

**2. use size for the component to solve problem**

**3. maintain the groupCount while doing the union**

besides union find we can also maintain the first and last count of each group because when getting left and right side count, we will only use first or last element

**4. use union find class to build a graph**

a. when union two nodes increase the edge by 1  
b. when no need to union two nodes, it means that this edge can be skipped/removed  
c. when have edge type for different person, create new DSU instance for each person, maintain a graph for each person  
d. use greedy idea to process edge type for both person first  
e. in the end if the edges in the DSU class == n - 1, then the graph is traversable
