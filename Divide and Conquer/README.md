## 1. Recover array with subsets sums

find one number from current subsets sums, then divide sums into two halves, first half(un-recovered arrays sums) + fixed num = second half, then do it recursively.  
if all positive nums, second smallest will be the fix number(smallest number); if negative is allowed, max - secondMax = smallest positve number or biggest negative number, need to try both
